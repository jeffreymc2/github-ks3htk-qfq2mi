# Introduction

This brand style guide provides details on Perfect Game's brand, identity, and social media policies and practices. These guide-lines reflect the company's principles, and we anticipate that every employee will carefully read them in order to understand their responsibilities at Perfect Game.

All prior Visual Identity Guidelines have been superseded by this Brand Style guide. The rules of this Brand Style guide are subject to revision, deletion, and addition by Perfect Game. Such changes, deletions, or additions must all be made in writing. The most recent version of the policies and procedures may be found at www.Perfect Game.com, where you can also get the online version of this Brand Style guide. This Brand Style guide does not contain a comprehensive list of the Company's rules and processes.

We only outlined a few of the more significant ones. Please feel free to contact our Marketing & Design Team if an employee or affiliate has any questions or issues about this Brand Style guide or any other policy or process stated therein. A key component of the company, the Perfect Game logo serves as a legal trademark and quality assurance. The principles that follow show how adaptable our brand identity is, and they should be utilized to encourage and stimulate artistic expression.

Our brand, color scheme, and contemporary font all contribute to the creation of a distinctive framework that defines Perfect Game.
